# EECS-4612-Design-Of-32-bit-ALU
In this project, I designed a 32-bit Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) based on a hierarchical structure. 
The design was first simulated and then implemented in the form of a complete chip using Cadence layout design tools.

By the end of this project, I was able to use professional computer-aided VLSI design tools to 
(1)Simulate my written HDL code, 
(2) Synthesize my design, 
(3) Place and Route mu synthesized HDL,
(4) Use a pad frame to build a full chip, 
(5) export my final GDS file.
